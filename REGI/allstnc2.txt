In some countries, hotels can be classified as three-star, two-star, or one-star.
A hotel’s quality may be assessed using a certification process such as a AAA or AARP membership.
Another way to classify hotels is by the amount of space they offer, such as the number of guestrooms or square footage of the hotel’s building.
A three-star hotel has fewer guestrooms than a two-star, but more than a one-star.
In most countries, there are regulations that govern how much a hotel must charge its customers.
Some hotels offer packages that include meals, spa services, swimming pools, meeting rooms, and other amenities. 
These packages can vary in price from one hotel to the next, but they are usually offered at a higher cost than a comparable stay at an average motel or hotel.
