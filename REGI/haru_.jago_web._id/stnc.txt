If you’re unsure about how to segment your audience, a good place to start is by looking at your competition.
Some companies, such as Nike, have taken the time to identify their target markets.
They then develop different products and services to cater to these different groups.
These are known as shopper segments.
The best approach is to determine which types of audience are likely to respond to your campaign.
You can do this by running A/B tests.
Testing various combinations of ad placement and targeting techniques is a great way to find the right audience for your business.
Creating a well-crafted marketing plan will help you reach more customers.
However, your success will depend on your ability to serve the right people in the right segment at the right time.
Luckily, it’s not difficult to create a shopper segmentation scheme, and testing a variety of strategies will help you determine which method works best.
Behavioral targeting is another effective method to reach a particular demographic.
Using this technology, marketers can predict future purchases based on their previous behavior.
Additionally, retargeting is a useful tactic for getting interested individuals back to your website.
