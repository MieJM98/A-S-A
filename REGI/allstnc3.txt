If your goal is to get your content seen, it’s best to create an interesting video with a compelling story.
While videos are great for entertaining your friends, they can also be an excellent source of information.
Educational videos are evergreen. Only die when the educational value goes out of date.

Lastly, you can send videos to friends via email.
